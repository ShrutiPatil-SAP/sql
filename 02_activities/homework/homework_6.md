**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

My previous work experience in this cohort till now has been excellent. I am a Pharmacist by profession trying to transit into this new field of Data science. My main focus till now was entirely upon the technical part of this stream. After thursdays class I learnt about the critical areas related to ethics and inequity that require deeper consideration. I realised the importance of ethics in long term in any project.

To bring about ethics in my work, my main aim would be to ensure the data is reliable,fair,unbiased and is protected. People trust the institutions collecting the data and it's the reponsibility of the institutions to protect the data and the privacy of the people involved. In thodays world it has become utmost important to protect the data as we have seen in many such data theft or cyber attack incidences where data if fallen into the wrong hands can cause havock. I consider it itâ€™s my responsibility to flag these concerns and work toward solutions that mitigate harm, ensuring fairness in the design, collection, and use of data.

I would strive to ensure that my contributions reflect diverse perspectives, taking into account the impact of technology on underrepresented communities. In product design or database structures, I would be more mindful of accessibility, user inclusion, and whether the output might disadvantage certain populations. For instance, ensuring data representation from marginalized groups and actively designing for inclusivity would be a priority moving forward.
